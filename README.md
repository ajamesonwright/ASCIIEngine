IN PROGRESS: A little engine intended for generating and rendering simple geometry.
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING: A quadtree structure to divvy up the space to (hopefully) simplify collision detection.

Left pane shows a top down view of the environment and allows click-and-drag geometry additions. 
Right view will show the first person rendering of this geometry using ASCII characters.
